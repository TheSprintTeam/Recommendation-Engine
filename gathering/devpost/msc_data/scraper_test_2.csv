Initially the topmost bucket had 2 inches of fine aggregate 2 inches of activated charcoal 2 inches of sand peels of orange and 2 inches of coarse aggregate Upon close collaboration with users it was found that the numerous layers of filter media werent very hygienic and its replacement was a huge problem
To overcome this issue we took inspiration from the Baffle filtration process that involves the use of physical barriers or baffles to treat wastewater However implementing this process in such a compact setting is difficult however with a little out of the box thought we managed to integrate this system in the bucket resulting in better treatment efficiency The first six containers act as baffles slowing down the flow of water allowing sediments and other materials to settle and filter The last two containers contain sand and activated carbonpeels of orange With this mechanism users will only need to detach a particular container from the network and replace the filter media instead of having to empty the entire stack and layers Sand will strain out the suspended matter solids from the greywater and activated charcoalpeels of orange will remove organics that affect the taste odour color of the water The wastewater will pass through these and get filtered The treated and clear water gets stored in the middle part of the BV which can be connected to flushing cistern or can be usedreused for nonpotable uses",machine-learning

https://devpost.com/software/securechain-p7w6u2,"Blockchain Although it was a Hackathon and the time was limited I wanted to create a Blockchain structure ready to be used as a real world service Thats why I created two new ERC standards ERC721 and ERC20 with a validation step I presented the two standards as EIPs the ERC721 has been accepted you can find it as theEIP6997 and the ERC20 is in process to be accepted as the EIP7144
These two standards have a validation step in every transfer and approve transactions except transfer transactions from an approved address I created this exception because right now a lot of DAOs request the user the allowance to move their assets and expect it to act like the ERC721 or ERC20 standards with this small change the DAOs will be able to directly transfer the assets without noticing they are ERC6997 or ERC7144 EIP6997 In an ideal case all the NFT Collections and Token Smart Contracts would use these two standards to protect the owners but I knew to have better chances to success you should adapt to the actual market not to expect the actual market to adapt to your project and the actual market is plenty of ERC721 and ERC20
With this in mind I created two wrapper Smart ContractsxNFTVsolandxTokenVsolthat allow you to migrate your NFTs and Tokens to the new secured standards The migration will be done with theupgradefunction and can be reverted with thedowngradefunction this last function also require a validation step to protect your assets xNFTVsol xTokenVsol upgrade downgrade Now that we have the system to generate the secured NFTs and Tokens we can explain the core of the Blockchain structure TheControlsolSmart Contract allows the structure to control the secured assets It has thedeployxNFTVanddeployxTokenVfunctions passing as a parameter an NFT or Token Smart Contract address they will deploy anxNFTVsolorxTokenVsol This deployed wrapper Smart Contracts will allow to migrate the assets to secured assets for example a BAYC NFT into a xBAYC or the token USDC into xUSDC
In the deployment it will set theControlsolSmart Contract address as the validator address of the new wrappers Controlsol deployxNFTV deployxTokenV xNFTVsol xTokenVsol Controlsol After the deployments theControlsolhave direct connection with Chainlink Functions to accept the validations of the wrappers It requests the validation status withexecuteRequestfunction and the DON fulfill the request with thefulfillRequestfunction in case is an accepted validation it calls the respective validation function of the wrapper validateTransfervalidateApprovalvalidationDowngrade
TheexecuteRequestfunction can only be called by the validator address this will be used by the Backend of Securechain and can be changed by the contract owner as a recovery plan in case of a Backend attack Controlsol executeRequest fulfillRequest validateTransfer validateApproval validationDowngrade executeRequest When I was developing theControlsolthe Smart Contract exceeded the limit code size introduced by Spurious Dragon to solve this problem I created theDeployersolto deploy the wrappers and connected to theControlsolusing the interfaceIDeployersol It also connects with the wrappers using the interfaceIValidationsol avoiding import thexNFTVsolandxTokenVsolSmart Contracts Controlsol Deployersol Controlsol IDeployersol IValidationsol xNFTVsol xTokenVsol The owner ofControlsolMUST validate the validator address once a month using theincreaseActiveTimefunction if not all the wrapped NFTs and Tokens will mutate and act like the ERC721 and ERC20 standards allowing the users to directly transfer and approve their assets without the validation step
It should never happen but I didnt want to have the user assets blocked with the impossibility of validate the transfer or approve petitions in case Securechain shut down or disappear My main goal was that the Blockchain structure would not depend on the Backend and no matter what happened it could mutate and continue working without locking user assets Controlsol increaseActiveTime With the normal ERC721 and ERC20 standards you have a full Blockchain security for your assets with the Blockchain structure I created you have two steps security Blockchain and Backend
Having theControlsolSmart Contract as the validator of all the wrapped assets I saw the opportunity to create a third security type the full Backend security Calling the functionvalidatePermissionyoull access the Full Control mode giving the validator address the allowance to move all your wrapped assets
With this mode youll be able to transfer your NFTs and Tokens directly from Securechain I dont recommend it because its a centralization of your assets but maybe some users are afraid of losing their private key and prefer the traditional system where they can recover their password It would allow to transfer your assets directly from the website without wallet extension and at the same time having your assets in your hot wallet Controlsol validatePermission This was an explanation of what the Blockchain Structure does on Securechain if you want to learn more about how it works in theSmart Contract Folderof the Github Repository youll find all the Smart Contracts with all the functions commented and the EIPs of the new standards Smart Contract Folder Backend I developed a Backend capable to connect with the Blockchain using a Quicknode endpoint Although it first was a proof of concept Backend I wanted to develop it with all possible security measures users and oracles authentication validation of ownership before address register curated error handling for all the functions The Backend can accept validations but NEVER can change validations information this information is strictly registered in the Blockchain structure AuthController The Authentication Controller contains all the authentication functions It has the functionsloginregister then to validate logged users before every private endpoint will useisLoggedInfunction To finalize with the functionisOracleAuthit will validate if the caller is a Chainlink Oracle this function is required to call the close validation endpoint login register isLoggedIn isOracleAuth ContractsController The Contract Controller contains all the functions related with the creation of the wrapper Smart Contracts It allows to create the wrapper Smart Contract of an existent NFT or Token Smart Contract with the functioncreateContract Also has a get of the Contracts by wrapper address or original address ERC721ERC20 To finalize it contains the functions to get the user assets the secured and not secured ones using Quicknode Graph API createContract PermissionController The Permission Controller contains all the functions related with the Full Control mode It allows the users to see if they are in Full Control mode and the transactions they did deny the mode with thedenyPermissionfunction or transfer NFTs and Tokens with thesendNFTsendTokenfunctions denyPermission sendNFT sendToken UserController The User Controller contains all the functions related with the user information It allows the user to get and edit his personal information and see if a usernameemailaddress is taken
The functionsetAddressreceive by parameter a signed message from the Frontend of which it recovers the user address
Also thechangePasswordfunction encrypt the password before saving it in the database setAddress changePassword ValidationController The Validation Controller is the most important one it contains all the functions related with the validations It allows the users to get the validations data and accept the validations with the functionacceptValidation The function will call theexecuteRequestfunction of the Control Smart Contract
Also contains thecloseValidationfunction only callable by the Chainlink Oracles acceptValidation executeRequest closeValidation Events Listening The Backend needs to listen the Blockchain Smart Contracts to get the changes in the Blockchain structure
With the Quicknode endpoint via websockets I created 6 Blockchain subscriptions to listen the new events and save the information in the database ThesubscriptionDeployto get the new wrapper Smart Contracts data thesubscriptionDowngradesubscriptionTransfersubscriptionApproveto get the new validation data thesubscriptionValidatedto get the accepted validations data and thesubscriptionFullControlTransactionsto get the Full Control transactions subscriptionDeploy subscriptionDowngrade subscriptionTransfer subscriptionApprove subscriptionValidated subscriptionFullControlTransactions SmartRepository To facilitate interaction with the Blockchain I developed the SmartRepository all the callstransactions or other functionalities that require web3js are packed into this Repository In the video youll find an explanation of how the validation process works Frontend My main objective with Securechain was to develop a hybrid transfer validation system using Blockchain and Backend Im not used to Frontend development and my focus was on Backend and Blockchain development but I wanted to create a Frontend to show how the users will interact with Securechain
Although was not my first objective I created a quite complete Frontend It contains an authentication system with LoginRegister pages and a Logout option the authentication token will be stored in the local storage To do all the Blockchain operations I created a SmartRepository for the Frontend too this one connects to the Blockchain using Metamask and ethersjs When the user is logged and have a Blockchain address will be able to navigate between the Assets and Validations pages The first one will be used to generate wrapper Smart Contracts Upgrade assets and Downgrade assets The validations page will be used to accept the validations and see the closed ones In the Full Control page the user will need to accept the Full Control mode If he accepts the mode hell be able to directly transfer his wrapped assets","javascript, mongodb, node.js, npm, solidity"

A simple concept but building it to be cryptographically secure is fairly challenging So much so that a valid construction was only recently proposed in a 2022 theory paper coming out of the Boneh laboratory It satisfied many challenging requirements namely 1 having no central point of failure 2 preserving the original vault and 3 tracing back to signers The scheme does so while providing security guarantees of unforgeability and accountability
We built out this primitive from scratch first team to do so to our knowledge To demonstrate how powerful it is we deployed a crosschain vault on ZetaChain thats secured by a 5of7 threshold signature Any adversary that wishes to drain the vault must compromise 5 signature shares in the span of 30 seconds We think this would be unlikely","rust, typescript"

https://devpost.com/software/investment-installments,"This project allows two parties to come together and ideally both benefit I have in a sort of tongue in cheek way named the parties using this application Big Money and Wagie Big Money as the name implies is someone that has a lot of capital available and Wagie is someone who might not have a lot of available capital but has a steady and reliable income stream available In this initial implementation Ive modeled the scenario as in the Inspiration section above where I really would have liked to buy a lot of Chainlink tokens but didnt have the capital to buy them all readily available With this project I could have gone to Big Money my brother in this example and he could have market bought a bunch of Chainlink and deposited it into this smart contract to hold So essentially Big Money and Wagie come to an agreement before hand and Big Money is able to create a new financial agreement with which Wagie can interact When launching a new Financial Agreement Big Money configures the following information 
The asset that is going to be deposited into the agreement and the amount of that asset Chainlink tokens in this case
The client ie Wagies wallet address with which the client will interact with this agreement
The terms of the agreement which in includes the number of payments to be made the premium rate any security deposit rate the payment period ie a payment due every week every month etc and the grace period if the payment period is 1 month and the grace period is 5 days then if 5 days pass after the payment is due the payment is considered delinquent and at that point Big Money can execute a terminate agreement function and retrieve his funds plus any security deposit from the conract Once all of that is configured the agreement is live and Big Money is given an Agreement ID which will be used for both parties to interact with the agreement in the future From here both Wagie and Big Money can interact with the agreement if they are using the proper wallet addresses as configured Wagie can access the agreement information through the ClientInteraction component Things are very simple for Wagie here and all he needs to do is click the make a payment button and all of the calculations are taken care of for him So if Big Money for example has deposited 10 Link tokens into the contract the value in ethereum of those tokens is recorded at the time of deposit And say it is configured that 5 payments will be made with a 10 premium and a 5 security deposit When Wagie clicks the make a payment button he is sending 15 the amount of ethereum based on the time of deposit plus a 10 premium directly to Big Money the 5 security deposit gets sent to the contract to be held Once Wagie has made his final ie fifth payment the 10 Link tokens are sent to Wagie and his security deposit gets returned to him in full and Big Money has made his initial investment back plus a 10 return ie the premium rate Big Money can also interact with the agreement from the FinancierInteraction component Here Big Money can see all of the information related to the financial agreement in question including whether or not it is delinquent ie the payment is past due If the payment IS delinquent Big Money can execute the Terminate Agreement function at which point the Chainlink Tokens will be returned to him plus he will receive whatever amount of security has been deposited to the contract if a security deposit was configured","javascript, solidity"

To create a Drive smart contract users can navigate to the homepage and deploy the contract by selecting Create new drive In addition if an existing drive has been shared with a user it can be loaded into the text field below This process allows users to have complete control over their stored data with the added benefit of increased security and accessibility provided by the Filecoin blockchain Creating buckets Creating buckets A bucket is a logical grouping of CIDs that allows for easier organization and management of files To create a bucket users can navigate to the Drive smart contract page and select the appropriate drive they wish to create the bucket in Then they can click on the Create new bucket button and give the bucket a name Once the bucket is created users can add CIDs to it by uploading files to IPFS and obtaining their respective CIDs These CIDs can then be added to the bucket using the Add CID to bucket function Users can also remove CIDs from the bucket or transfer ownership of the bucket to another user using the appropriate functions available on the bucket page Overall creating a bucket allows for more efficient and organized management of CIDs within a Drive smart contract Users can easily group related files together and make changes to their organization as needed Managing Files Managing Files With the bucket created you can now upload files to IPFS and manage them onchain To upload a file click on the Upload file button Select the desired file from your device and click on Upload to IPFS This will initiate the upload process to IPFS generating a unique CID for the file To complete the upload click on Upload to smart contract This is storing the CIDs content on the chain and leveraging the power of IPFS and the capabilities of the smart contract to provide a robust and secure solution for file storage and management on the blockchain If you require additional security for your content IPDrive offers the option to encrypt files before uploading them to the IPFS network To upload an encrypted file enter a key before initiating the upload process Decrypting files in IPDrive ensures that only authorized users with the correct encryption key can access and view the content This provides an additional layer of security for your sensitive information Finally IPDrive also gives the ability to delete rename and star the cids and store this information onchain starting all the actions onchain providing transparent and tamperproof audit trails This ensures that all actions performed on the content such as deletion renaming and starring are recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered or manipulated By storing these actions onchain IPDrive provides transparency and immutability ensuring that all changes made to the content are verifiable and traceable This audit trail not only enhances security but also enables users to track and verify the history of file modifications deletions and other actions Managing Accessilibilty Managing Accessilibilty One of the features of IPDrives smart contract is the ability to control access to the content As the owner of the Drive smart contract you can add users and control their level of access There are two access levels available Readonly access Users with this access can view the content in the bucket They can see all the CIDs in the bucket and download the contents of the CIDsRead and write access Users with this access can not only view the content in the bucket but also contribute by adding or removing files from the bucket Readonly access Users with this access can view the content in the bucket They can see all the CIDs in the bucket and download the contents of the CIDs Read and write access Users with this access can not only view the content in the bucket but also contribute by adding or removing files from the bucket Unauthorized access is blocked preventing unauthorized users from accessing the CIDs and buckets By utilizing IPDrives access control feature you can securely share files while maintaining control over who can access and modify them This provides an efficient and controlled way to collaborate and share information with others ensuring the integrity and security of your data","react, solidity"

In each round 10 minutes users are free to place bets for the first 5 minutes Next 5 minutes no bets will be placed by the user and the results will be updated at the end of the round Winners will be split 99 of the reward based on their bet amount The remaining 1 is the fee to maintain the project
 How we built it
I use CosmWasm and rust to build smart contract for the project Nextjs and injectivets for the front end
On the server side there will be a python task to trigger functions that start and end rounds
Website is deployed on Vercel
 Challenges we ran intoSome of the functions of injectivets are not detailed in the documentationInitially I used Pyth Network for the testnet version But they dont update the data very often so I used live price data from CEXs instead
 Accomplishments that were proud of
Im happy to have built an initial version on the testnet Everything works relatively stable
 What we learned
I am a data engineer and smart contract developer on EVMcompatible blockchains But in this project I learned how to build smart contracts using CosmWasm how to build web applications and features like data query blockchain interaction for website
 Whats next for DOM Predict
Currently the project is stopping at price prediction for INJ Next I plan to add other cryptocurrencies and integrate the price chart into the website If users enter an UP position and the End Price is higher than the Start Price  they WIN If users enter a DOWN position and the End Price is lower than the Start Price  they WIN

Inspiration
The inspiration for our project Eco Trip came from witnessing the growing concern about climate change and the need for sustainable living We realized that while people are aware of the importance of reducing their carbon footprint they often lack the knowledge or tools to make informed decisions about their travel choices As avid travelers ourselves we wanted to create a solution that could help users make environmentally conscious travel decisions enabling them to contribute to the fight against climate change in their own way What We Learned
Throughout the project we learned the significance of researching and understanding the intricacies of carbon emissions and various modes of transportation We delved into studies and data provided by environmental organizations government bodies and scientific journals This helped us understand the complexities of carbon emissions in different scenarios such as varying distances occupancy levels and vehicle types We also gained valuable experience in web development as we built our web application using various tools and frameworks Our team honed their skills in frontend and backend development user experience design and API integration Building the Project
To create Eco Trip we followed a structured approach Research We started by researching the factors that contribute to a vehicles carbon emissions such as fuel efficiency distance traveled and passenger count This allowed us to develop an algorithm that could accurately estimate the carbon emissions of different travel choices Design We designed a userfriendly interface focusing on simplicity and visual appeal We wanted to ensure that our users could quickly understand the purpose of the application and easily input their travel preferences Development Our team utilized modern web development technologies such as React for frontend development and Nodejs for backend development We integrated various APIs such as Google Maps and public transportation data to provide accurate and uptodate information Testing Throughout the development process we continually tested our application to ensure its reliability and accuracy We sought feedback from users and iterated on our design and functionality to improve the overall experience Challenges Faced
During the development of Eco Trip we faced several challenges Data Accuracy Ensuring the accuracy of our carbon emissions algorithm was a primary concern We had to carefully analyze and validate our sources to ensure that our estimates were as precise as possible API Integration Integrating multiple APIs with varying data formats and access limitations proved to be challenging We had to design a flexible system that could accommodate these differences while still delivering a seamless user experience Usability Striking the right balance between providing detailed information and maintaining a simple intuitive interface was a challenge We iterated on our design multiple times to ensure that our application was both informative and userfriendly Despite these challenges we remained determined and persevered in creating a valuable tool that can help users make more environmentally conscious travel decisions We are proud of Eco Trip and believe that it can make a difference in the fight against climate change","css, django, html, javascript, node.js, react"

https://devpost.com/software/latest-invention,BTS is an application that is focusing on a seller and its customer at a time What I felt while going through the previous years hackathon entries and all other projects that are present on the internet I felt that all of them are just utilizing the same way using a seller as an entity that is always selling a tangible item and the buyer just buying the item I know there were many meaningful additions also but I thought of revamping the whole structure of utilizing Square In this digital era there are tons of B2B B2C and P2P productscompanies out there that are doing the same stuff So I thought of making an educational game that will be acting as a Point of Sale for a seller while the players buyers to be precise will be buying intangible game assets Lets deep dive of actually what is happening Why a gameBelieve it or not games are those magnets that can attract almost everyone out there and ensure that the end user is not bored at any point And this is not just a game it is an EDUCATIONAL  PROMOTIONAL game for Square also There are a total of 3 subgames out of which 2 are having things structured in such a way that a player will be getting to know about the services provided by Square and also reach the specific documentation pages Why a game Which Square SDKsAPIs are being usedWeb payment SDK is being used to collect payment from the player whenever a purchase is being made Customers orders and gift card APIs are used to ensure the smoothonboarding process  flow of the project Which Square SDKsAPIs are being used Landing PageAfter entering the required files in the form fields CUSTOMER API  will first check whether these details are already attached to a customer If that result comes out to be TRUE then no new record is being made and in this manner the customerplayer logs into hisher account Whereas if the result is FALSE then a new customer object will be created  then the user can sign up for the application Custom attributes are also assigned to each contact object so that I can keep track of the application variables like score levels  much more Landing Page Game CanvasThis is the area on which the player has to move in and find the 4 houses that will start a new gameprocessing There are divisions with a lot of icons on either side of the canvas The side division contains various models that can be opened according to the context On the canvas itself there are 4 houses so lets discuss them Game Canvas NoteFor entering any room on the game canvas a specific key has to be pressed and to enter the game the backspace key has to be pressed Wrong answers will decrease the score whereas correct answers will increase the score Note 1Square Video GameThis house can be accessed by going to the dock which is present in the bottomright corner of the map Keyvhas to be pressed in order to enter the game and in there the payer has to first watch a video that will be a youtube video from Squares channel and will be telling about the core concepts of Square services  Say the time duration of the video is 2 minutes 120 seconds so the video will be played for a total of 135 seconds I am providing extra 15 seconds so that the user can get some spare time in which heshe can go back  forth to peek at something important After the video timer runs out a set of4 questions will appear the player has to choose the correct answers from the dropdown Once the 30 seconds timer runs out for giving the answers the answers will be calculated against the correct ones and if they are correct then only the player will move onto the next level followed by an increase in score In this manner Square Video Game v 4 questions will appear In this manner the player will get to know the basic  advanced videos explaining Square and its products 2Flip the Cards GameThis house is in the bottomleft corner of the map Keybtakes the player into the game and there you have to flip the tiles and make a correct TRIPLETA correct triplet is a logical combination of an image tile  2 textual components tileFor example The square image tile has to be matched with web SDK text tiles becauseSquare provides web SDKs for payment Once a correct triplet is made the score increases Players can also take a hint by clicking on the question mark icon but the condition is that the hint can only be taken once per level and that also can be used after clocking the first tile of the triplet In the initial levels the tileset is 33 9 whereas for the last 2 levels the tileset increases to 5315 making the game more competitive as no hints will be provided on those levels Flip the Cards Game b A correct triplet is a logical combination of an image tile  2 textual components tile Square provides web SDKs for payment 3Maze RunnerThe topright house can be accessed by the keyjand in it there are 6 mazes that the player has to pass A timer of stipulated time runs for each level and within that time the level has to be cleared If the player cant make it to the next maze then the player will be respawned back to the initial position This is clearly a game for those who are arcade lovers and loves solving puzzles Maze Runner j 4Personal Room The dead endThe player must enter the topleft room only at the end of the gameplay because it is a dead end and doesnt allow coming back to the game canvas So when the player is done playing and enters this room then by going near the television set the stats collected through the entire gameplay can be seen and thus the user can actually see how many levels he passed and information like that Personal Room The dead end,"css, javascript, node.js, square"
