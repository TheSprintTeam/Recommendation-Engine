City State ZIP Subject Request for Coverage of Trastuzumab for Jane Smith Dear Insurance Providers Name I am writing to appeal the denial of coverage for Trastuzumab for my patient Jane Smith who has been diagnosed with HER2overexpressing breast cancer I believe that Trastuzumab is an essential component of her adjuvant treatment plan and its denial could have a detrimental impact on her overall prognosis and quality of life Jane Smith was recently diagnosed with invasive breast cancer The biopsy confirmed HER2 overexpression in her tumor which indicates an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with a higher risk of recurrence and worse prognosis HER2 overexpression has been established as an important biomarker for targeted therapy with Trastuzumab in breast cancer patients
Trastuzumab a monoclonal antibody targeting the HER2 receptor has revolutionized the treatment of HER2positive breast cancer Its use in the adjuvant setting has consistently demonstrated significant improvements in diseasefree survival DFS overall survival OS and reduced risk of recurrence when combined with standard chemotherapy Several landmark clinical trials have established the efficacy and safety of Trastuzumab as an integral part of the treatment regimen for HER2positive breast cancer For instance the HERA trial HERceptin Adjuvant conducted by PiccartGebhart et al 2005 demonstrated a 46 reduction in the risk of recurrence and a 33 reduction in the risk of death in patients who received one year of adjuvant Trastuzumab compared to those who did not The BCIRG 006 trial Slamon et al 2011 revealed a 40 reduction in the risk of recurrence and a 34 reduction in the risk of death with the addition of Trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy The National Comprehensive Cancer Network NCCN guidelines widely recognized as a standard of care for oncology strongly recommend the inclusion of Trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of HER2positive breast cancer The guidelines emphasize the importance of Trastuzumab in improving outcomes and reducing the risk of recurrence thus underscoring its clinical significance Given the wellestablished efficacy and safety profile of Trastuzumab it is imperative that Jane Smith be granted coverage for this essential therapy By denying access to Trastuzumab we risk compromising her chances of achieving optimal disease control and longterm survival I kindly request a reconsideration of your decision and urge you to provide the necessary coverage for Trastuzumab for Jane Smith Her health and wellbeing depend on timely access to appropriate treatment options and I am confident that approving coverage for Trastuzumab aligns with the best interests of both Jane and your organization Thank you for your attention to this matter I would be more than willing to provide any additional information or discuss the case further to assist in the reconsideration process Sincerely Your Name

https://devpost.com/software/smart-rescueai,In emergency situations every second counts However when the emergency call center is overwhelmed or understaffed callers may have to wait for a long time before their call is answered This delay can be critical and could result in a loss of life or propertyAt situation of emergency when a caller dials the emergency number and there are no available handlers the call is automatically redirected to the Smart Rescue system The system then asks the caller to describe the emergency situation and uses NLP and ML algorithms to  analyze the content of the call Based on the context and phrases used by the caller the system grades the importance of the call and assigns it a priority levelIf the call is urgent AI will immediately transfer the relevant information to the handler This information includes the callers location a transcript of the call and any other relevant details If the call is less urgent Smart Rescue may provide automated responses to guide the caller through the situation until an emergency handler is available Our hackathon project RescueAI solves this problem by using artificial intelligence to grade the importance of each call and transfer the relevant information to the emergency operator This helps emergency services to respond more efficiently and effectively potentially saving lives and reducing property damageThe Features which we have in RescueAI AIpowered call management RescueAI uses natural language processing NLP and machine learning ML to identify the urgency of each call and prioritize them accordinglyCall grading based on keywords RescueAI grades each call based on the keywords spoken by the caller This allows the system to quickly identify urgent calls and transfer them to the emergency handlerLocation tracking RescueAI also records the location of each caller and provides this information to the handlerCall transcript RescueAI provides a transcript of each call to the emergency handler allowing them to quickly and accurately assess the situation and respond accordinglyAutomated responses In some cases RescueAI can provide automated responses to callers to guide them through emergency situations until an emergency handler is availableRescueAI is aiming to increase emergency communication throughput while reducing emergency call systems issues and making the process of emergency response more efficient,python
https://devpost.com/software/cascade-u14fdb,It is a platform for both projects support and creationIt behaves as an interface between founders and contributors where the latter can plan their

as an interface between founders and contributors where the latter can plan their contributions over a specified period give out their funds to a secured contract let the payments be sent automatically and still pull back if they dont feel confident anymore at some point As a creator A project can be submitted with basic information name description links categories and both the addresses and shares of the collaborators It is a submission for a funding campaign so it is clear from the start how the funds will be distributed When the project is created a child contract is generated and it will hold the contributions and states of withdrawalsMeaning that if a collaborator has a share of 50 of the contributions they will never be able to withdraw more than 50 of the funds Meaning that if a collaborator has a share of 50 of the contributions they will never be able to withdraw more than 50 of the funds As a contributor The contribution process is a bit more elaborated As the creators can submit a project and then withdraw their current share at any time the contribution system is can be automated A contributor needs to create an account a smart contract that will act as an interface They can then register a Chainlink Keeper from the app set a payment interval then the Upkeep will  provided with enough LINK  calculate the contributions to send and transfer them to the projects at the chosen interval They can always trigger these payments manually at any time A contribution is always created with a fixed amount and an end date The calculation will attempt to equally distribute these funds over the selected period meaning that all the funds would be sent when the period is over Lets get through the process quickly to understand how it works The contributor finds a project they want to support They click contribute choose 100 MATIC and an end date 2 months from now The 100 MATIC are stored inside the contributor account and the storage is updated in the contract They have now dedicated these funds to this contributionwith confidence that it is safely stored and that they can support the project gradually without worrying about monthly deductions from their bank accountOne week later the upkeep is performed it calculates the appropriate amount which will be 125 MATIC and sends it to the project The contributor could have triggered it a few days earlier then this previous amount would be deducted and the project would still end up with the same amount If there are multiple contributions the process is exactly the same as all payments are done in a rowThe collaborators receive the contribution in their contract They are two with an equal share They had received another 10 MATIC contribution earlier that the first collaborator had already withdrawn Now the first collaborator can withdraw 625 MATIC and the other one can withdraw 1125 MATICIf the contributor is happy with it it will continue until the contribution period is over and the funds fully sent Howeverif they were upset with it and wanted to cancel it right now they could as well update it and receive back the remaining 775 MATIC They could also increase or decrease the contribution amount The contributor finds a project they want to support They click contribute choose 100 MATIC and an end date 2 months from now The 100 MATIC are

These two standards have a validation step in every transfer and approve transactions except transfer transactions from an approved address I created this exception because right now a lot of DAOs request the user the allowance to move their assets and expect it to act like the ERC721 or ERC20 standards with this small change the DAOs will be able to directly transfer the assets without noticing they are ERC6997 or ERC7144 EIP6997 In an ideal case all the NFT Collections and Token Smart Contracts would use these two standards to protect the owners but I knew to have better chances to success you should adapt to the actual market not to expect the actual market to adapt to your project and the actual market is plenty of ERC721 and ERC20
With this in mind I created two wrapper Smart ContractsxNFTVsolandxTokenVsolthat allow you to migrate your NFTs and Tokens to the new secured standards The migration will be done with theupgradefunction and can be reverted with thedowngradefunction this last function also require a validation step to protect your assets xNFTVsol xTokenVsol upgrade downgrade Now that we have the system to generate the secured NFTs and Tokens we can explain the core of the Blockchain structure TheControlsolSmart Contract allows the structure to control the secured assets It has thedeployxNFTVanddeployxTokenVfunctions passing as a parameter an NFT or Token Smart Contract address they will deploy anxNFTVsolorxTokenVsol This deployed wrapper Smart Contracts will allow to migrate the assets to secured assets for example a BAYC NFT into a xBAYC or the token USDC into xUSDC
In the deployment it will set theControlsolSmart Contract address as the validator address of the new wrappers Controlsol deployxNFTV deployxTokenV xNFTVsol xTokenVsol Controlsol After the deployments theControlsolhave direct connection with Chainlink Functions to accept the validations of the wrappers It requests the validation status withexecuteRequestfunction and the DON fulfill the request with thefulfillRequestfunction in case is an accepted validation it calls the respective validation function of the wrapper validateTransfervalidateApprovalvalidationDowngrade
TheexecuteRequestfunction can only be called by the validator address this will be used by the Backend of Securechain and can be changed by the contract owner as a recovery plan in case of a Backend attack Controlsol executeRequest fulfillRequest validateTransfer validateApproval validationDowngrade executeRequest When I was developing theControlsolthe Smart Contract exceeded the limit code size introduced by Spurious Dragon to solve this problem I created theDeployersolto deploy the wrappers and connected to theControlsolusing the interfaceIDeployersol It also connects with the wrappers using the interfaceIValidationsol avoiding import thexNFTVsolandxTokenVsolSmart Contracts Controlsol Deployersol Controlsol IDeployersol IValidationsol xNFTVsol xTokenVsol The owner ofControlsolMUST validate the validator address once a month using theincreaseActiveTimefunction if not all the wrapped NFTs and Tokens will mutate and act like the ERC721 and ERC20 standards allowing the users to directly transfer and approve their assets without the validation step
It should never happen but I didnt want to have the user assets blocked with the impossibility of validate the transfer or approve petitions in case Securechain shut down or disappear My main goal was that the Blockchain structure would not depend on the Backend and no matter what happened it could mutate and continue working without locking user assets Controlsol increaseActiveTime With the normal ERC721 and ERC20 standards you have a full Blockchain security for your assets with the Blockchain structure I created you have two steps security Blockchain and Backend
Having theControlsolSmart Contract as the validator of all the wrapped assets I saw the opportunity to create a third security type the full Backend security Calling the functionvalidatePermissionyoull access the Full Control mode giving the validator address the allowance to move all your wrapped assets
With this mode youll be able to transfer your NFTs and Tokens directly from Securechain I dont recommend it because its a centralization of your assets but maybe some users are afraid of losing their private key and prefer the traditional system where they can recover their password It would allow to transfer your assets directly from the website without wallet extension and at the same time having your assets in your hot wallet Controlsol validatePermission This was an explanation of what the Blockchain Structure does on Securechain if you want to learn more about how it works in theSmart Contract Folderof the Github Repository youll find all the Smart Contracts with all the functions commented and the EIPs of the new standards Smart Contract Folder Backend I developed a Backend capable to connect with the Blockchain using a Quicknode endpoint Although it first was a proof of concept Backend I wanted to develop it with all possible security measures users and oracles authentication validation of ownership before address register curated error handling for all the functions The Backend can accept validations but NEVER can change validations information this information is strictly registered in the Blockchain structure AuthController The Authentication Controller contains all the authentication functions It has the functionsloginregister then to validate logged users before every private endpoint will useisLoggedInfunction To finalize with the functionisOracleAuthit will validate if the caller is a Chainlink Oracle this function is required to call the close validation endpoint login register isLoggedIn isOracleAuth ContractsController The Contract Controller contains all the functions related with the creation of the wrapper Smart Contracts It allows to create the wrapper Smart Contract of an existent NFT or Token Smart Contract with the functioncreateContract Also has a get of the Contracts by wrapper address or original address ERC721ERC20 To finalize it contains the functions to get the user assets the secured and not secured ones using Quicknode Graph API createContract PermissionController The Permission Controller contains all the functions related with the Full Control mode It allows the users to see if they are in Full Control mode and the transactions they did deny the mode with thedenyPermissionfunction or transfer NFTs and Tokens with thesendNFTsendTokenfunctions denyPermission sendNFT sendToken UserController The User Controller contains all the functions related with the user information It allows the user to get and edit his personal information and see if a usernameemailaddress is taken
The functionsetAddressreceive by parameter a signed message from the Frontend of which it recovers the user address
Also thechangePasswordfunction encrypt the password before saving it in the database setAddress changePassword ValidationController The Validation Controller is the most important one it contains all the functions related with the validations It allows the users to get the validations data and accept the validations with the functionacceptValidation The function will call theexecuteRequestfunction of the Control Smart Contract
Also contains thecloseValidationfunction only callable by the Chainlink Oracles acceptValidation executeRequest closeValidation Events Listening The Backend needs to listen the Blockchain Smart Contracts to get the changes in the Blockchain structure
With the Quicknode endpoint via websockets I created 6 Blockchain subscriptions to listen the new events and save the information in the database ThesubscriptionDeployto get the new wrapper Smart Contracts data thesubscriptionDowngradesubscriptionTransfersubscriptionApproveto get the new validation data thesubscriptionValidatedto get the accepted validations data and thesubscriptionFullControlTransactionsto get the Full Control transactions subscriptionDeploy subscriptionDowngrade subscriptionTransfer subscriptionApprove subscriptionValidated subscriptionFullControlTransactions SmartRepository To facilitate interaction with the Blockchain I developed the SmartRepository all the callstransactions or other functionalities that require web3js are packed into this Repository In the video youll find an explanation of how the validation process works Frontend My main objective with Securechain was to develop a hybrid transfer validation system using Blockchain and Backend Im not used to Frontend development and my focus was on Backend and Blockchain development but I wanted to create a Frontend to show how the users will interact with Securechain
Although was not my first objective I created a quite complete Frontend It contains an authentication system with LoginRegister pages and a Logout option the authentication token will be stored in the local storage To do all the Blockchain operations I created a SmartRepository for the Frontend too this one connects to the Blockchain using Metamask and ethersjs When the user is logged and have a Blockchain address will be able to navigate between the Assets and Validations pages The first one will be used to generate wrapper Smart Contracts Upgrade assets and Downgrade assets The validations page will be used to accept the validations and see the closed ones In the Full Control page the user will need to accept the Full Control mode If he accepts the mode hell be able to directly transfer his wrapped assets","javascript, mongodb, node.js, npm, solidity"
